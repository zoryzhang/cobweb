"""
A partition/clustering is derived by generating the 'best' partition 
based on the memberships of the instances among the children of the root (i.e. the concepts at the 2nd level).

We generate this partition by multiple simulations.
Given a number of splits, nth_split, in each recursion, 
we choose a concept at the 2nd level to split (i.e. remove it and elevate its children to the 2nd level)
that results in the greatest category utility (of the branch including the root and its children).

Thanks to Erik Harpstead for his previous work.
